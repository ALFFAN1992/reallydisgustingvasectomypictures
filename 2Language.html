2.1 Medias & Language Control
<br>
<br>
What goes on over the news is what you know. It is the basis by which you make judgements, by which you think. You are the controlled product
of news programming. Television programming dominates the exposure of ideas and information. Corporations that own networks control them.
Corporations are not responsible to government, to their employees, to their shareholders. -Richard Serra
<br>
<br>
News & journalism are owned by what is it now, 6 companies that own 90% of what we read, watch or listen to? Do a quick image search and you 
can find a good amount of these graphs... If these six media groups were to have any malicious intentions or a desire to collaborate and 
preserve a narrative, it would be possible. If in any way it could benefit their profitability, they will do it. 
<br>
<br>
News is useless to you, but if you are going to bother watching it, pay very close attention to the wording.
<br>
KKK, Conspiracy Theory, Ultranationalist, Alt-Right, Progressive, Democrat, Republican... These words are tossed around a good amount. 
<br>
Most people like to watch Star Wars, and a common form of escapism is to make the world more like the fantasy settings you consume.
<br>
Language can make anyone sound like a hero, propaganda has been around for thousands of years.
<br>
<br>
Republicans sound like the fucking Star Wars villains. Alt-Right Conspiracy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Conspiracy, wow, 
a crazy conspiracy! A christian wackjob conspiracy, conspiracy KKK Alt-Right Republican Evil Conspiracy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Anything sounds ridiculous when you say it like that.
<br>
<br>
Why would you criticize (PERSON)? They have donated to many Progressive Movements.
<br>
<br>
Progressive, progress... Democrat, democracy these words remind you of things that are good. So you begin to abstract what a progressive
movement is, it is a political movement that could advocate for murdering children and you would support it because it is  
PROGRESS, PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT. 
<br>
<br>
Other than that hedonism is a big player, fuck man. I heard this song this one time playing in public, and it went like wasting time
is all I've known it's all I do. It did not pull any punches this shit was absolutely fucking insane. I can't imagine if this is what 
passes in public spaces imagine all the subtle ways music throws ideas at you. Feeling pleasure isn't that important to you and be a purist
when it comes to media. Go for old media, it might fuck with you but in ways you can immediately recognize.
