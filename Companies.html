Business Entities 
<br>
<br>
Companies aim solely to make money. No fucking exceptions. 
<br>
<br>
Right off the bat you tell me this is clearly <a href="http://reallydisgustingvasectomypictures.net/Language.html">'unsubstantiated conspiracy'</a>- B-but this coffee (link to mind altering drug article) company donates 0.01% of its funds (link to an article called lies or something) to NGOs! (link to article, six figure 
salary NGO owner) This is aimed, intentionally, to promote the good image of the company. This donation is made to rationalize your remorse after purchasing a product (because of its environmental or social damage) and/or rationalize the company as a 
healthy, charitable entity within civilization. Simultaneously, do not forget that companies exploit cheap, expendable labour of poor countries at the given opportunity of turning a higher profit. Re-examine the priorities behind these actions.
<br>
<br>
This is their objective. 
<br>
<br>
1.1 Strategies:
<br>
<br>
*Donations: Because it improves public image. Headlines will advertise donations to a <a href="http://reallydisgustingvasectomypictures.net/Language.html">Progressive Movement</a> and no further research into what they are ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTING TO will be made.
<br>
*Rent-seeking: Gain from a monopoly/use of influence to receive benefits from government. In 1945, corporations paid 50 percent of federal taxes. Now they pay about 5 percent. 
<br>
*Out-sourcing: Undercutting and selling out the workers of a country for the work of those in poor, undeveloped countries who will work for cheap and need to eat. 
<br>
*Tax shelters: Exploiting tax benefits by setting up offshore subsidiaries which severely reduce or eliminate the need to pay taxes.
<br>
*Advertising: Means of convincing you to buy a product. advertisements on televisions, radios, billboards, telephones (link to distractions) 'press' headlines designed to appear like they are not advertisements.
<br>
<br>
Companies sell you out immediatelly to The State and Foreign Powers if given the opportunity. They do not care. They do not care about your freedom. They will fuck you up if it means making an extra dollar
on Angry Birds. It's called consolidation. Strengthen governments and corporations, weaken individuals. With taxes, this can be done inperceptibly over time.
<br>
<br>
Shareholders buy stock in companies and don't even know what the companies do. 
<br>
<br>
1.2 Infrastructure 
<br>
<br>
Companies are so big you don't even know who you're working for. That's terror. Terror built into the system. You are in a complex network that acts through and towards you, and has been developed
to convince you to be as efficient and to prolong your stay as much as possible. 
<br>
<br>
What is driving you to work for a conglomerate? Do you genuinely crave it on any natural, psychological level or was it repeated to you so many times that you believed it was necessary for your development?
<br>
<br>
When infrastructure gets this intricate, several problems arise. Firstly, how do you hold anyone in high positions accountable for their actions? How do you hold anyone accountable for 
unreparable damage that can be force correlated to unrelated causes, and for day-to-day horrors? In such a system, even if you have a tried-and-true system of checks and balances what stops someone
from corrupting this system at any point in time unseen? What is secure, or functional about companies and prevents them from behaving as torture chambers? 
<br>
<br>
It was not always like this. 
<br>
<br>
In 1900, 90% of Americans were self-employed; Now it's about two percent. 
<br>
<br>
Mass production is only profitable if its rhythm can be maintainedâ€” that is, if it can continue to sell its product in steady or increasing quantity. 
The result is that while, under the handicraft or small-unit system of production that was typical a century ago, demand created the supply, to-day supply must actively 
seek to create its corresponding demand. A single factory, potentially capable of supplying a whole continent with its particular product, cannot afford to wait until the 
public asks for its product; it must maintain constant touch, through advertising and propaganda, with the vast public in order to assure itself the continuous demand which 
alone will make its costly plant profitable. This entails a vastly more complex system of distribution than formerly.
<br>
<br>
Companies HAVE TO be manipulative to operate through a factory-based system. 
<br>
<br>
Slavery of some kind is accepted when interacting through a business entity. 
<br>

1.3 Advertising and Information 
<br>
<br>

<br>
1.3.2 Economy
<br>
<br>
Business offers graphic examples of the effect that may be produced upon the public by interested groups, such as textile manufacturers losing their markets. This problem arose, not long ago, when the velvet manufacturers were facing ruin because their product had long been out of fashion. Analysis showed that it was impossible to revive a velvet fashion within America. Anatomical hunt for the vital spot! Paris! Obviously! But yes and no. Paris is the home of fashion. Lyons is the home of silk. The attack had to be made at the source. It was determined to substitute purpose for chance and to utilize the regular sources for fashion distribution and to influence the public from these sources. A velvet fashion service, openly supported by the manufacturers, was organized. Its first function was to establish contact with the Lyons manufactories and the Paris couturiers to discover what they were doing, to encourage them to act on behalf of velvet, and to help in the proper exploitation of their wares. An intelligent Parisian was enlisted in the work. He visited Lanvin and Worth, Agnes and Patou, and others and induced them to use velvet in their gowns and hats. It was he who arranged for the distinguished Countess This or Duchess That to wear the hat or the gown. And as for the presentation of the idea to the public, the American buyer or the American woman of fashion was simply shown the velvet creations in the atelier of the dressmaker or the milliner. She bought the velvet because she liked it and because it was in fashion.
<br>
<br>
The editors of the American magazines and fashion reporters of the American newspapers, likewise subjected to the actual (although created) circumstance, reflected it in their news, which, in turn, subjected the buyer and the consumer here to the same influences. The result was that what was at first a trickle of velvet became a flood. A demand was slowly, but deliberately, created in Paris and America. A big department store, aiming to be a style leader, advertised velvet gowns and hats on the authority of the French couturiers, and quoted original cables received from them. The echo of the new style note was heard from hundreds of department stores throughout the country which wanted to be style leaders too. Bulletins followed despatches. The mail followed the cables. And the American woman traveler appeared before the ship news photographers in velvet gown and hat.
<br>
<br>
The created circumstances had their effect. "Fickle fashion has veered to velvet," was one newspaper comment. And the industry in the United States again kept thousands busy. 
<br>
<br>
1.4 The Banking Cartel
<br>
<br>
When the housing industry bubble crashed (likely intentionally) the bankers used the argument that they were too big to fail to receive tax-payer funded bailouts from the government. 
This is an example of privatizing gains and socializing losses. You never win in this situation. 
<br>
<br>
Banks lend money at interest. Usury and debt are insane. having to pay for your existence and working 40 years to pay off a house is insane.
