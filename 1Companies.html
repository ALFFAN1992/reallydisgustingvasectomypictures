Companies have one goal and it is to make money. Given the opportunity, a company will resort to any tactics they can to make more money. 
Offshore tax shelters, rent-seeking, indentured servitude & sweat shops are all possibilities if an executive decides they will increase
revenue for the new version of Angry Birds. Always pay attention when a company makes a small donation with every purchase to Africa,
it is an intentional means of controlling your guilt when consuming a product.

Never forget that when a brand donates to or supports a cause, it's only because an executive pointed out that it would be beneficial for 
their bottom line. If Hitler came back from the dead and you could make 500 million dollars by supplying him weapons and ammunition by making 
a public donation of 10 million dollars, any company would jump on it. Economic survival is the priority.
