SWEET TALKING DEMOTIVITATIONALS AND HOT ISSUE BRATS: A REVIEW OF THE MASLOW'S PYRAMID AND THE 2010s PART 1
<br>
<br> 
You’re either some sweet-talking demotivational who thinks he's the hotshot or a brat who’s got something to say on next week’s hot issue;
You’re stuck in one of these two pitfalls, rilling as you hate the opposite. This came from your love of the Maslow's pyramid, didn’t it 
dimweed? Whether you follow it or not, there’s a great sense of potential in a person that comes from knowing and avoiding the Maslow’s 
pyramid. 
<br>

Take an actual second to look at it. Does anyone actually believe this shit? This is why we don’t have flying cars yet, you morons. 
While the first 2 parts of this pyramid are obvious (no shit) I fail to understand the positions of the rest of these. 
These lead you to absolute misery, to becoming some high smoke hippie in in the parking lot of your local coffee shop. 
Hey man, i’m totally self fulfilled brother, you want a toke? Do you see yourself “self-fulfilled” in a life like that, man... 
<br>
<br> 
Lives of successful people tend to seem without a soul, people on the old television who make a lot of money look plastic and simple 
and the same could be said for most people who use social media meticulously. These people in the second group can and will sometimes 
imply they are “weird” but it is very difficult to actually do something that is weird, seeing as everything that is “weird” follows 
a certain popularity that you don’t find in the actual world of strange happenings,, the obscure of the world. “Alternative” people 
end up becoming more normal than the regular crowd, because their difference from the in crowd is largely vague or false.

There’s no point in complaining if not to propose a fix to the issue, i’d say. I see that a lot, with the new age problems we’ve always 
heard about, like this left wing and right wing assfuckery that has completely shat on the opportunity of the 2010s. Truth is the 
internet only gives the illusion that these are serious issues (People are not used to this yet), and complaining that both sides are 
stupid is even worse so it’s best to avoid it entirely. Avoiding it entirely, is the three layered solution found beneath deceit and 
bullshittery. Point is, if you’re gonna complain about something, you better know how to fix it! You gotta be 5 steps ahead of all 
competition in every direction.

I sure do not like the current president of the United States! Well what are you doing about it? Sitting there on a social media platform 
writing something like that. What do you think’s gonna happen, do you think he’s gonna respond to you and tell you he’s sowwy and resign? 
Do you think if you tell other people you hate muslims in your country they’ll all disappear, you right wing or left wing nitwit? 
Truth is, you could be enjoying your life instead of pointlessly whining and complaining it away, it’s very easy.

Listen, to get back to Maslow’s pyramid, here’s what I suggest: Take the first base 2 parts of the triangle to heart, but chance is 
you already have something settled for them. Third one’s alright I suppose, but it can be vague. 
Friends can help give a sense of reality, so i’m all for it. This is where you stop, and avoid going completely backwards where the 
majority goes. You don’t need those last 2, they just kinda seem like a scam to render you to buy products or something (see private 
consumerism) I’d say you don’t need them though. All you need is those basic 3, they are the real needs that will keep you alive. 
I’m not going to tell you what you need to do! That was what the Maslow's pyramid was trying to do. Go do something that hasn’t been 
done before or something, but avoid life’s pitfalls.
