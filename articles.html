SWEET TALKING DEMOTIVITATIONALS AND HOT ISSUE BRATS
<br>
You’re either some sweet-talking demotivational who thinks he's the hotshot or a brat who’s got something to say on next week’s hot issue;
You’re stuck in one of these two pitfalls, rilling as you hate the opposite. This came from your love of the Maslow's pyramid, didn’t it 
dimweed? Whether you follow it or not, there’s a great sense of potential in a person that comes from knowing and avoiding the Maslow’s 
pyramid.

Take an actual second to look at it. Does anyone actually believe this shit? This is why we don’t have flying cars yet, you morons. 
While the first 2 parts of this pyramid are obvious (no shit) I fail to understand the positions of the rest of these. 
These lead you to absolute misery, to becoming some high smoke hippie in in the parking lot of your local coffee shop. 
Hey man, i’m totally self fulfilled brother, you want a toke? Do you see yourself “self-fulfilled” in a life like that, man...
