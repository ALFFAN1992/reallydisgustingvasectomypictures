Press Language & Linguistic Weapons
<br>
<br>
News & journalism media are owned by 6 companies that own 90% of what you could potentially read, watch or listen to. Do a quick image search and you 
can find a good amount of graphs. If these six media groups were to have any malicious intentions or any desire to collaborate and 
preserve a narrative, it would be possible. If in any way it could benefit them they will do it.
<br>
<br>
Press is useless and has in most cases never been used for any good. What do you get from watching prepared information designed to manipulate you to believe things?
Pay very close attention to the wording.
<br>
<br>
1.1 Wording
<br>
<br>
KKK (Scary Hollywood Movie Villains, not a FBI Honeypot), Conspiracy Theory(Abstract or Speculative Information), Ultra-nationalist (Deep love for one's country), Alt-right (Conservatives), 
Progressive (Associated with optimism towards the future, suggesting all new things are good), Democrat (Hollywood Good Guys), Republican (Scary Hollywood Movie Villains) 
<br>
<br>
Most people like to watch Star Wars. People who have a,b,c,x variable movies input into them from Hollywood influence give out a definite output that operates within the scheme of 
these analoguous concepts. What I mean is, a common form of escapism would be to desire for your life to be more like Star Wars. You then begin to associate the Star Wars conceptions of 
archetypes to real-world organizations and movements. So if you implant or publicize a movie which operates within language that mirrors the real world in a way where the language can be 
re-associated, people can potentially falsely correlate this language to groups (despite any differences in intentions that may exist).
<br>
<br>
Depending on the press television (link to Distractions) channel that you watch, either one of the Democrat-Republican groups will be worded more like the Hollywood villain. This is to preserve the 
American Democrat-Republican Feud.
<br>
<br>
I swear, Republican sounds like the fucking Star Wars villains. Alt-Right Conspiracy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Conspiracy, wow, 
a crazy conspiracy! A christian wackjob conspiracy, conspiracy KKK Alt-Right Republican Evil Conspiracy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<br>
<br>
Anything sounds ridiculous when you say it like that.
<br>
<br>
1.2 Progress 
<br>
<br>
Why would you criticize (PERSON)? They have donated to many Progressive Movements.
<br>
<br>
That's all language. 
<br>
<br>
Progressive, progress... Democrat, democracy these words remind you of things you may think are good. So you begin to abstract what a progressive
movement is, what it really means. It could advocate for something bad and you would support it because it is  PROGRESS, PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT
<br>
<br>
1.3 Avoiding Language
<br>
<br>
I don't think the situation will improve, so if you would like to avoid confusing attempts at convincing you to believe things you would benefit from avoiding the press as much as possible.
