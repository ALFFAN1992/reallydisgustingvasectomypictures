All Saints' Eve 

This one's devastating. One night I was watching phone videos of homeless people on a bench. 'Creole Man meets Homeless Man' and then 'American Homeless Man meets Canadian Homeless Man'. 
It was your typical fare for the night. Through the fog I saw a savage man approach. Before I could say anything, he yelled at the top of his lungs: 

-Gadzooks!...For Science! Eureka!

Spit dripping down from his mouth, he told me about his newest bet on the Sportsball Yellow Socks Little League Team.

-Why'd you bet on the Sportsball Yellow Socks Little League Team?

Not responding, he began erratically yelling out 'Albert Einstein' and walked away.

Share this nightmare-inducing story with your friends this holiday season.

A horse walks into a bar.
The horse says: The usual, please.                  
The man responds: Why is there a horse in my bar?

Bricks

There once was a man named Petri Islo, he went up to a brick at the corner of a street, and the brick told him:
''They don't make em like they used to.''
And he was confused for a moment, looked around, looked both ways
''Who said that?''
And again and again he heard the brick at the corner of the street talking and murmuring;
''Remember the 90s?''
And the man said:
''I have no idea who is talking currently. Please show yourself.''
''Look again.''
The brick had a comically large pipe in its mouth
