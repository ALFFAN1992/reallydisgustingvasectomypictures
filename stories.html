All Saints' Eve 
<br>
This one's devastating. One night I was watching phone videos of homeless people on a bench. 'Creole Man meets Homeless Man' and then 'American Homeless Man meets Canadian Homeless Man'. 
It was your typical fare for the night. Through the fog I saw a savage man approach. Before I could say anything, he yelled at the top of his lungs: 
<br>
-Gadzooks!...For Science! Eureka!
<br>
Spit dripping down from his mouth, he told me about his newest bet on the Sportsball Yellow Socks Little League Team.
<br>
-Why'd you bet on the Sportsball Yellow Socks Little League Team?
<br>
Not responding, he began erratically yelling out 'Albert Einstein' and walked away.

Share this nightmare-inducing story with your friends this holiday season.

A horse walks into a bar.
<br>
The horse says: The usual, please.  
<br>
The bartender responds: Why is there a horse in my bar?

There once was a man named Petri Islo, he went up to a brick at the corner of a street, and the brick told him:
<br>
''They don't make em like they used to.''
<br>
And he was confused for a moment, looked around, looked both ways
<br>
''Who said that?''
<br>
And again and again he heard the brick at the corner of the street talking and murmuring;
<br>
''Remember the 90s?''
<br>
And the man said:
<br>
''I have no idea who is talking currently. Please show yourself.''
<br>
''Look again.''
<br>
The brick had a comically large pipe in its mouth

I went to my local museum, which had a sign up advertising the new T-Rex exhibit:

Woah, I saw a T-Rex in Jurassic Park once. Those are so cool.
<br>
I entered into the museum.
The entrance said ''Ministry of Public Information''. That's an odd name for a museum.
Proceeding I saw a group of people assembling bones together and coming up with designs for the dinosaurs. 
I heard they're making a new Jurassic Park Movie this year. All in all a very a fun trip.
