All Saints' Eve 
<br>
This one's devastating. One night I was watching phone videos of homeless people on a bench. 'Creole Man meets Homeless Man' and then 'American Homeless Man meets Canadian Homeless Man'. 
It was your typical fare for the night. Through the fog I saw a savage man approach. Before I could say anything, he yelled at the top of his lungs: 
<br>
-Gadzooks!...For Science! Eureka!
<br>
Spit dripping down from his mouth, he told me about his newest bet on the Sportsball Yellow Socks Little League Team.
<br>
-Why'd you bet on the Sportsball Yellow Socks Little League Team?
<br>
Not responding, he began erratically yelling out 'Albert Einstein' and walked away.
<br>
Share this nightmare-inducing story with your friends this holiday season.

A horse walks into a bar.
<br>
The horse says: The usual, please.  
<br>
The bartender responds: Why is there a horse in my bar?
<br>

There once was a man named Petri Islo, he went up to a brick at the corner of a street, and the brick told him:
<br>
''They don't make em like they used to.''
<br>
And he was confused for a moment, looked around, looked both ways
<br>
''Who said that?''
<br>
And again and again he heard the brick at the corner of the street talking and murmuring;
<br>
''Remember the 90s?''
<br>
And the man said:
<br>
''I have no idea who is talking currently. Please show yourself.''
<br>
''Look again.''
<br>
The brick had a comically large pipe in its mouth
<br>

I went to my local museum, which had a sign up advertising the new T-Rex exhibit:
<br> 
<br>

<br> 
<br> 
Woah, I saw a T-Rex in Jurassic Park once. Those are so cool.
<br>
I entered into the museum.
The entrance said ''Ministry of Public Information''. That's an odd name for a museum.
Proceeding I saw a group of people assembling bones together and coming up with designs for the dinosaurs. 
I heard they're making a new Jurassic Park Movie this year. All in all a very a fun trip.

It's a sunny day in the Smileshappy City Autonomous Democratic Block. Jonestown Massacre heads to his compulsory education 
Net_Classroom (courtesy of BOBO_NET). 
<br> 
<br> 
Fight the System plays on the intercom. 
<br> 
<br> 
He meets with a friend, Johnny Columbine. If you were from around these parts, you were sure to know him... Bright guy. 
Sticked his britches a little too close to the pole though, if you know what I mean. 
<br> 
<br> 
J. Columbine had answered an email from AD-PUNCH, and so when you'd talk to him, he would begin:
<br> 
<br> 
-Have you ever heard of FORD MOTORCLASS? I've been looking at FORD MOTORCLASS recently. 
<br> 
<br> 
-Haven't heard of FORD MOTORCLASS, Johnny. Thanks for letting me know. 
<br> 
<br> 
The sound of planes roar the sky. Jonestown overhears a conversation about sex from the other side of the classroom. Oh,
it's just Isla Vista Shooting Smith. She received implants at age -5 because she felt her unexistence needed more 'pazzaz'.
<br> 
<br> 
The anthem of UNCOM begins playing on the intercom. To venerate UNCOM UNITED NATIONS BRANCH, every single school topic has 
been changed with Science. For Science! Eureka! shout the students who hold close to their hearts Tony Stark from the classic
movie Ironman 1.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
Johnny went to a local restaurant called Henry's Ale 
<br> 
<br> 
The waiter held a surprised expression and screamed.
<br> 
<br> 
He then noticed he had entered the local restaurant naked with a swastika painted on his chest
<br> 
<br> 
Woops!
<br> 
<br>
